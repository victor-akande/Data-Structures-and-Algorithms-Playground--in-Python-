# This code is for rotating a given square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place, meaning the original matrix is modified directly without using an additional matrix for rotation. Let's go through the code step by step:

## 1. **Function Definition**:
    - `def rotate(matrix):`: This line defines a function named `rotate` that takes a 2D square matrix (`matrix`) as its parameter.

## 2. **Matrix Transpose**:
    - The first loop (`for i in range(len(matrix)):`) iterates through the rows of the matrix.
    - The nested loop (`for j in range(i, len(matrix)):`) iterates through the columns of the matrix, starting from the diagonal element.
    - In each iteration, it swaps the elements across the diagonal (`matrix[j][i]` and `matrix[i][j]`), effectively performing a transpose operation.

## 3. **Row Reversal**:
    - After transposing the matrix, the code reverses each row of the transposed matrix.
    - The loop (`for i in range(len(matrix)):`) iterates through each row of the matrix.
    - `matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]` reverses the row `matrix[i]` using slicing (`[::-1]` reverses the order of elements in a list).

## 4. **Return and Test**:
    - `return matrix`: The function returns the modified matrix after rotation.
    - `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`: This line initializes a sample 3x3 matrix.
    - `print(rotate(matrix))`: The function `rotate` is called with the sample matrix as an argument, and the rotated matrix is printed.

## **Explanation of Rotation**:
- Transposing the matrix effectively swaps rows and columns, rotating the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.
- Reversing each row after transposition ensures that the elements in each column are arranged in reverse order, completing the clockwise rotation.

## **Output**:
- The output of `print(rotate(matrix))` will be the rotated matrix:
  ```
  [[7, 4, 1],
   [8, 5, 2],
   [9, 6, 3]]
  ```
  This output represents the original matrix rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.
