# This code is a Python implementation of finding the single non-duplicate number in a list of integers. Let's break it down step by step:
## 1. `nums = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,8,8]`: 
This line initializes a list called `nums` containing integers, some of which are repeated.
## 2. `def Solution(nums):`: 
This line defines a function named `Solution` that takes a list of integers (`nums`) as its parameter.
## 3. `res = 0`: 
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the result.
## 4. `for num in nums:`: 
This line starts a loop that iterates through each element (`num`) in the input list `nums`.
## 5. `res ^= num`: 
This line uses the XOR (`^=`) bitwise operator to update the value of `res`. XOR-ing a number with itself results in 0, so if a number appears twice in the list, it will cancel out and not affect the final result. However, the single non-duplicate number will remain in `res`.
## 6. `return res`: 
After the loop, the function returns the value of `res`, which is the single non-duplicate number in the input list.
## 7. `print(Solution(nums))`: 
Finally, this line calls the `Solution` function with the `nums` list as an argument and prints the result.
In summary, this code efficiently finds the single non-duplicate number in a list of integers using bitwise XOR operations, resulting in a linear time complexity solution. In this specific example, the output will be `5`, as it is the only number that does not have a duplicate in the list.
